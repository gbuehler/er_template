# er_template
This is a template proposed for Testbed-12 Engineering Reports.  The objective is for editors to check this out (Clone a version) and begin editing it with a tool such as AsciidocFX.

Note that the file index.adoc should not be modified, but you should begin with er.adoc.  The file er.adoc has some metadata information and a list of includes from the list of files below.  NOTE:  The includes in the first group below should not need to be adjusted (just modify the file as necessary).  You will need to modify the include statements of the clauses-examples as stated below and potential remove or add annexes.  All documents should include the history and bibliography so these includes should not be changed (edit the files as required).


 * preface.adoc
 * intro.adoc
 * references.adoc
 * terms.adoc
 * overview.adoc


 * clauses-examples.adoc  == use as many clause sections as necessary.  Number as clause-05.adoc, clause-06.adoc, etc.


 * annex-a.adoc  --|
 * annex-b.adoc    |-- Use as needed
 * annex-c.adoc  --|


 * history.adoc
 * bibliography.adoc
